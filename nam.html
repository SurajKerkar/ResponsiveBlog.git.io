         <p class="font1">Hiii ! I am Namrata . Today I am going to share something interesting as well as magical thing about our each and everyone’s life. In this generation everyone are too busy with their daily routine. It’s good to be busy but it’s not fair to be unhappy all the time. Life is something that we get at once, so we should enjoy each and every moment of our life whether it is good or bad, whether it is fair or unfair, whether it is happy or sad, everything we should experience. Life is what you make it. We are so caught up in the pursuit of fame, money, fortune because of which we lose the sight of important things in our life. There was a long time ago, where people used to be happy all the time even if they didn’t had luxurious life. Nowadays everyone are finding their happiness in money, status; this things are not giving the way to the happiness rather it is the way away from the happiness. I totally agree everyone are having ups and downs in their life but the person who finds happiness even in adverse condition is the successful individual of his life. Find the happiness in the little child laughing, find the happiness in seeing pleasant nature, find the happiness in painting and to lost yourself in beautiful colours, find the happiness in talking with your friends, find the happiness in spending quality time with your partner, find the happiness in listening peaceful songs, find the happiness in helping a needy person, find the happiness in praising special person, find joy in eating your favourite food. Just throw out all your worries and live your life joyfully , do whatever you want, whatever you feel like to do, don’t think about negativities around you. When you live your life while enjoying all this precious moment then it is called as Life. It is not hard, it is easy. It is not bad but with full of magical events. It is not negative, but it is with positive things hidden inside each and every page of your book. So what you need to do is just pull that positive hidden things from each page of your book and live your life with happiness. If you are able to do this, then you can do any impossible thing possible.
